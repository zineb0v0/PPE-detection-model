# PPE-detection-model
This project implements a comprehensive safety monitoring system that uses computer vision to detect personal protective equipment (PPE) violations in real-time. The system processes video streams, identifies safety compliance issues using YOLO object detection, and triggers alerts when repeated violations occur within configurable time thresholds.
